## Part 1 - Choose a Topic
- Joe thought the idea was cool and asked if it would be for all construction projects or just certain sizes of projects
	- -> Based on my initial searches for data sets it seemed like it would be projects of all sizes
- Samantha said "This is a great project idea!!"
- Josh asked if I'd get data to compare different cities 
	> I thought it would be cool to do that but it's been harder to process the data than I thought it would be 	> and I don't have time to look at other cities for this assignment. I haven't looked yet, but I imagine it 	> will be hard to make comparisons because different cities will likely track the data differently
